   How Routing can be done


Routes we have 
            
             -> InBound
             -> OutBound


steps

   *    Outbound Routes 
                
         connectivity -> Setup Trunk

         conncetivity -> setup outBound
  
   *    InBound Routes


                connectivity -> inbound Routes

                  - add incoming (Display name)

                  - set Extention (softphone name)
